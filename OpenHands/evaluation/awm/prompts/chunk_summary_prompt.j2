You are analyzing a segment of an agent's problem-solving trajectory.

## Problem Context
{{ problem_statement }}

## Trajectory Segment ({{ step_count }} steps)
{{ chunk_steps }}

## Task
Analyze this segment and extract the key information. Respond in the following format:

Phase: [one of: understanding, locating, fixing, testing, debugging]
Action: [brief summary of what actions were taken, e.g., "read config files, search for error pattern"]
Reasoning: [the key reasoning that led to these actions - WHY the agent made these decisions]
Files: [comma-separated list of files involved, or "none" if no files]
Outcome: [success/failure/error/ongoing, or "none" if not applicable]

Guidelines:
- Phase should reflect the PRIMARY activity in this segment
- Action should be concise (under 50 words)
- Reasoning should capture the decision-making logic (under 100 words)
- Focus on WHAT the agent learned or decided, not just WHAT it did
