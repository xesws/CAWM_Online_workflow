Given a list of successful Django bug-fixing/feature-implementation trajectories, extract common reusable workflows.

Each trajectory contains:
- Problem statement (GitHub issue description)
- Sequence of (thought, action) steps taken by the agent
- Final solution (diff patch)

Requirements:
1. Extract SUB-ROUTINES that appear across multiple tasks, not full task solutions
2. Abstract specific values: replace concrete file paths with {{target_file}}, specific error messages with {{error_pattern}}, etc.
3. Focus on PATTERNS and REASONING, not specific code
4. Each workflow should be 3-8 steps
5. Include the REASONING for each step, explaining WHY to do it
6. Workflows should be general enough to apply to multiple similar problems

Example workflow format:

## Workflow: Debug a Failing Test in Django
Description: A common workflow for identifying and fixing test failures in Django codebase.
Applicable scenarios: Test failure, assertion error, unexpected behavior in tests

Steps:
1. [Understand] Reasoning: Read the error message and stack trace to identify the failing test location.
   Action: search_code("{{error_keyword}}")

2. [Locate] Reasoning: Find the test file and the specific test method to reproduce the issue.
   Action: read_file("{{test_file}}")

3. [Trace] Reasoning: Understand what the test is checking and trace the execution flow to the source code.
   Action: read_file("{{source_file}}")

4. [Analyze] Reasoning: Identify the root cause of the failure by analyzing the code logic.
   Action: think("The issue is {{analysis}}")

5. [Fix] Reasoning: Apply the necessary fix to the source code to resolve the bug.
   Action: edit_file("{{source_file}}", {{changes}})

6. [Verify] Reasoning: Run the specific test case again to confirm the fix works and no regression occurs.
   Action: run_command("python -m pytest {{test_file}}::{{test_method}}")

Now, analyze the following successful experiences and extract common workflows:

{{ experiences }}

Extract up to {{ max_workflows }} common workflows from the above experiences.
Follow these guidelines:
- Use the exact format shown in the example
- Separate each workflow with "---"
- Make workflows specific enough to be useful but general enough to apply to similar problems
- Use placeholder variables like {{variable_name}} for values that change between instances
- Focus on the reasoning and decision-making process, not just the actions
